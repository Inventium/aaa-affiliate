# Convenience codes for advertising and affiliate on self-hosted WordPress

## Licensing

The plugin parts are GPL, of course, being dependent on WordPress.

The images are owned by the various businesses, for use exactly as here.

All other code is MIT.

If you're a coder who also runs a WP site, you may find this easier
to deal with than working on plugin code stashed away on the 
WP.org site.  Feel free to fork as necessary.

If you're a marketer, well, I'm not sure why you're hanging out 
on github.  But you are, so try to respect the community. If you 
take, give back.
